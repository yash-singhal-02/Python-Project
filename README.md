# PYTHON PROJECT ON IOLP_BUILDING_DATASET
# Objective 1:- 
<i>Total Square Footage by Region:<br>
-> A bar chart visualized total rentable square feet per GSA region, with
regions sorted by size.<br>
-> The mean square footage across regions was plotted as a reference line, and
z-scores identified outliers.<br>
-> The most extreme region (highest z-score) indicated a significant
concentration of large properties</i>

# Objective 2:- 
<i>Property Counts by Region:<br>
-> A pie chart showed the distribution of properties across regions, with
percentages highlighting disparities.<br>
-> The region with the most properties was identified, alongside the one with
the least.<br>
-> Covariance between square footage and property counts suggested a
moderate positive relationship, indicating that regions with more properties
tend to have larger total square footage.</i>

# Objective 3:- 
<i>Square Footage vs. Property Counts:<br>
-> A scatter plot revealed the relationship between property counts and total
square footage per region.<br>
-> A box plot displayed the distribution of square footage within each region,
highlighting variability and outliers.<br>
-> Covariance confirmed a positive correlation between counts and square
footage.</i>

# Objective 4:-
<i>Average Square Footage per Property:<br>
-> A bar chart compared average square feet per property across regions,
sorted in descending order.<br>
-> A stacked line chart contrasted total and average square footage, showing
regional trends.<br>
-> A heatmap visualized total square footage with annotated values,
emphasizing high-density regions.</i>

# Objective 5:-
<i>Geospatial Distribution:<br>
-> A scatter plot mapped properties by latitude and longitude, colored by
ownership type (Owned or Leased).<br>
-> The visualization highlighted geographic concentrations and ownership
patterns, aiding spatial planning.</i>

# Objective 6:-
<i>Construction Trends Over Time:<br>
-> A line plot tracked the number of buildings constructed per decade,
revealing historical trends.<br>
-> Peaks in certain decades suggested periods of significant federal
infrastructure development.</i>
